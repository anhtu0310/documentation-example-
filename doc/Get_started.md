# Get started with Rogo ESP32 WILE SDK

## Environment setup

Rogo ESP32 WILE SDK is based on the ESP-IDF version 5.1.1 release with added proprietary library for supporting Wi-Le network. Hence, the toolchain installation process is identical to the ESP-IDF published by Espressif.

[Links to Rogo ESP32 WILE SDK repo](https://github.com/RogoSolutions/rogo-esp32-sdk/tree/dev/v5.1.1 ':)')
**Note:** This link pointed to the **dev/5.1.1 branch** which currently is the correct and stable branch for the SDK 

### Manual installation 

[Linux and macOS](./linux_mac_install.rst ':)')

### Install with IDE  
*This method is highly recommended to novice users by **Espressif**! However the author of this docs find it subjectively confusing and recommend to install it manually especially if you are using **MacOS or Linux***

[Install using VScode extension](./vscode_extesion.md ':)')
